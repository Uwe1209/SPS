### Acquiring a Comprehensive Botanical Image Dataset for Sarawak: A Strategic Guide for the SmartPlant Sarawak Project

Date: 6th of October, 2025

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The "SmartPlant Sarawak" initiative is a technologically ambitious project designed to leverage artificial intelligence (AI), community science, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for plant identification, biodiversity mapping, and conservation in Sarawak.1 The cornerstone of this initiative is the development of a robust AI model capable of accurately identifying the region's vast and unique flora from user-submitted photographs. The success of this AI model is entirely contingent on the quality, comprehensiveness, and taxonomic accuracy of its underlying training dataset. This report provides a comprehensive strategic guide for acquiring and curating such a dataset.

The acquisition of a complete image dataset for all plants in Sarawak is not a matter of a single data download but a complex, multi-faceted undertaking that requires a sophisticated strategy. The botanical data landscape for Sarawak is distributed across local government institutions, international academic bodies, global digital repositories, citizen science platforms, and historical collections. No single source is sufficient.

This report presents a four-phase strategic framework to guide the data acquisition process. The strategy is built on a foundational understanding of Sarawak's unique institutional and regulatory environment. It recognizes that the project's existing partnership with the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC) and the local expertise of NeuonAI are critical diplomatic assets for navigating the state's data governance structures, particularly for engaging with the Forest Department Sarawak (FDS), the custodian of the authoritative Sarawak Herbarium, and the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre (SBC), the state's primary regulator of biodiversity research.

The proposed framework is as follows:

**Phase 1: Aggregation and Scoping.** This initial phase focuses on rapidly harvesting all publicly available digital data from global platforms like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and iNaturalist. Concurrently, a master species checklist for Sarawak will be compiled from authoritative publications to guide the collection process and enable a thorough gap analysis.

**Phase 2: Formal Institutional Engagement.** This phase involves leveraging the project's official partnerships to formally approach key Sarawak government agencies—namely the Forest Department Sarawak (FDS) and the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre (SBC)—to request access to their invaluable, non-public data holdings, including the state's primary herbarium database.

**Phase 3: Targeted Data Generation and Gap-Filling.** Addressing the data gaps identified in Phase 1, this phase outlines strategies for generating new data, such as commissioning targeted photographic fieldwork for under-represented species and proposing pilot digitization projects.

**Phase 4: Curation, Verification, and Structuring for AI.** The final phase details the critical process of integrating all disparate data sources, performing rigorous taxonomic verification, implementing ethical safeguards for sensitive species, and structuring the final dataset for optimal use in AI model training.

By following this strategic framework, the SmartPlant Sarawak project can systematically build a world-class botanical image dataset that will not only power its AI identification features but also serve as a lasting digital asset for conservation and research in Sarawak.

### 2. Part I: The Institutional Landscape: Primary Data Holders and Governance

A successful data acquisition strategy must begin with a nuanced understanding of the institutional and regulatory landscape. In Sarawak, botanical data is not a freely available commodity but a sovereign natural resource managed by a network of government agencies, each with a distinct mandate. Navigating this landscape effectively is the first and most critical step.

### 2.1. Deconstructing the Project Mandate and Key Partnerships

The technical requirements and strategic positioning of the "SmartPlant Sarawak" project itself dictate the approach to data acquisition. The project's scope document outlines an advanced mobile application with features that demand a dataset of exceptionally high quality and richness.1

**The "SmartPlant Sarawak" Initiative:** The application's core functions—AI-powered identification with confidence scores, community-driven label verification, interactive geospatial mapping with conservation status filters, and IoT-enabled protection for endangered species—impose specific, non-negotiable requirements on the source dataset. The images must be suitable for training a computer vision model, meaning they should be clear, high-resolution, and depict various parts of the plant (flower, leaf, fruit, bark). The associated metadata must include, at a minimum, an accurate scientific name and precise geographic coordinates. For advanced features, metadata on conservation status, habitat, and date of observation is also necessary. The system's design for continuous AI model improvement necessitates a dataset structured to accommodate ongoing validation and retraining with expert-verified images.1

**The Strategic Importance of NeuonAI and SFC:** The project's success is significantly bolstered by its two key partners. NeuonAI is a Sarawak-based artificial intelligence company with established expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and IoT.2 Its local presence, technical credibility, and existing collaborations with academic institutions like Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak provide a crucial bridge between the project's technical needs and the local research community.3 The partnership with the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC), a statutory body of the Sarawak Government, provides the project with official standing and high-level government endorsement.1 This relationship is the primary diplomatic tool for engaging with other government agencies. It elevates the data acquisition effort from a simple request by an external party to a collaborative, state-sanctioned conservation initiative.

### 2.2. Navigating Sarawak's Tripartite Biodiversity Authorities

The governance of biodiversity in Sarawak is distributed among three primary government bodies. While their mandates can appear to overlap, they have distinct roles that must be understood and addressed individually. The project's partnership with SFC is a key that can open doors, but it does not grant automatic access to the assets held by other agencies. A multi-agency engagement strategy is therefore essential.

**Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC): The Project Partner.** SFC's primary mandate is the management and conservation of Sarawak's Totally Protected Areas (TPAs), which include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and nature reserves.5 As the project's commercialization partner, SFC's role is that of a high-level facilitator, champion, and government liaison. While they possess extensive operational data related to park management and conservation activities, their core data holdings may not constitute the comprehensive, taxonomically verified botanical database required for AI training. Their most valuable contribution will be in formally introducing the project to other government bodies and endorsing its objectives.

**Forest Department Sarawak (FDS): The Data Custodian.** The FDS is arguably the most critical agency for this project's data acquisition goals. It manages the state's Permanent Forest Estates (PFEs) and, most importantly, is the custodian of the Sarawak Herbarium (SAR).7 The herbarium is the state's ultimate repository of physical plant specimens and their associated data. Therefore, any effort to build an authoritative dataset must involve a direct and formal engagement with the FDS. This is a separate workstream from the partnership with SFC and will require a dedicated proposal outlining the project's scientific and conservation merits.

**Sarawak Biodiversity Centre (SBC): The Research Regulator.** The SBC holds a unique and powerful mandate: to regulate all biodiversity-related research conducted within Sarawak.11 This includes governing access to and collection of biological resources. Any new fieldwork or data collection activities, which will likely be necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, will require a formal permit obtained through the SBC's Sarawak Online Research Application System (SORAS).13 The SBC also conducts its own advanced research, including bioprospecting and ethnobiology, and maintains a Natural Product Library derived from local flora.11 This indicates a deep well of in-house botanical expertise and potentially valuable data collections that could be accessed through collaboration. Failure to comply with SBC's regulatory framework could result in significant legal and operational setbacks for the project.

### 2.3. The Sarawak Herbarium (SAR): The Authoritative Foundation

At the heart of Sarawak's botanical knowledge infrastructure is the Sarawak Herbarium (SAR), managed by the Forest Department Sarawak. It represents the "ground truth" against which all other data sources must be measured.

**Collection Scope and Scale:** As one of the largest herbaria in Malaysia, SAR houses a collection of approximately 300,000 preserved plant specimens.10 This collection, which includes trees, shrubs, ferns, orchids, and palms, is the most complete and authentic record of Sarawak's flora, with some specimens dating back to the 1890s.10 It contains invaluable "type specimens"—the original specimens used to formally describe a new species—making it a globally significant scientific asset.16

**The BRAHMS Database: A Critical but Inaccessible Resource:** All data associated with the herbarium's specimens—including taxonomic identification, collection location, collector, and date—is systematically stored in the Botanical Research and Herbarium Management System (BRAHMS).10 BRAHMS is a powerful database software used by major botanical institutions worldwide and is capable of supporting online public portals.18 However, extensive research reveals no evidence of a public-facing online portal for the Sarawak Herbarium's BRAHMS instance. Access to this digital information is not open; it is controlled by the herbarium's curator and requires a formal request for data or a physical visit by approved researchers.10

**Utility and Limitations of Herbarium Data for AI:** The data within BRAHMS is of immense value. It can be used to generate the most accurate and comprehensive species checklist for Sarawak. If digitized images of the herbarium sheets exist, they provide taxonomically perfect labels. However, the images themselves—of pressed, dried, and mounted plants—are visually very different from living plants in their natural habitat. Consequently, they are suboptimal for training an AI model intended for in-field identification by the general public. The primary value of the SAR collection and its BRAHMS database for the SmartPlant Sarawak project is twofold: first, to provide the authoritative species list to guide data collection, and second, to serve as the ultimate reference standard for verifying the taxonomic accuracy of images obtained from other sources.

### 2.4. Leveraging Academic Expertise: Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)

Local academic institutions are a vital resource for expertise, specialized data, and potential collaboration. Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) stands out as a key potential partner.

UNIMAS's Faculty of Resource Science and Technology has robust research programs focused on biodiversity, conservation, taxonomy, and plant resource science and management.21 Researchers at UNIMAS have published numerous academic papers on specific components of Sarawak's flora, such as orchids, gingers, and palms, indicating deep taxonomic expertise within the faculty.23 The university also maintains its own living collections, such as the UNIMAS Orchidarium, which could be a source of high-quality, expertly identified images.23 Establishing a formal collaboration with UNIMAS could provide the project with access to these specialized datasets, invaluable expert assistance for validating species identifications from crowd-sourced platforms, and opportunities to engage students in targeted fieldwork or data curation tasks.

| Institution | Acronym | Primary Mandate | Key Data/Asset Relevant to Project | Access Protocol/Contact Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### 3. Part II: Harvesting Existing Digital Datasets

While institutional engagement is crucial for accessing authoritative data, the bulk of readily available, in-situ plant images resides on global digital platforms. These resources, built on data aggregation and citizen science, offer a powerful starting point for dataset construction. A strategy that begins by harvesting this low-hanging fruit allows the project to build a substantial base dataset quickly, which can then be refined, verified, and augmented with institutional data.

### 3.1. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF): The Master Aggregator

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an international network and data infrastructure that provides open access to biodiversity data from around the globe.25 It does not host data directly but aggregates it from a vast network of publishers, including museums, universities, government agencies, and citizen science projects.

**Data for Sarawak:** For the SmartPlant Sarawak project, GBIF is the single most important starting point for acquiring digital occurrence records. A query filtered for the kingdom Plantae within the administrative boundaries of Sarawak will return tens of thousands of records from hundreds of different datasets.26 Many of these records are georeferenced and include links to associated images. Crucially, major citizen science platforms like iNaturalist and Pl@ntNet are significant contributors to GBIF, meaning their data can often be accessed through this central portal.28

**Technical Protocol:** The data acquisition process from GBIF should be systematic. Using the web portal's search interface, filters can be applied for Taxon (Plantae), Country (Malaysia), and Administrative area (Sarawak). Additional filters, such as "Has image" and "Has coordinate," are essential. For large-scale and repeatable data acquisition, using the GBIF API is recommended. All data downloaded from GBIF must be properly cited, attributing the original data publishers as required by the platform's terms of use.

**Data Quality Considerations:** The great strength of GBIF—its scale and diversity of sources—is also its primary weakness. Data quality is highly variable. The project's data pipeline must include steps to clean GBIF-derived data. This includes filtering out records with flagged geospatial issues, such as points falling on country centroids, at coordinates (0,0), or in the ocean when they are for terrestrial species.27 It is also critical to assess the reliability of the data publisher and, wherever possible, trace records back to their original source for further verification.30

### 3.2. Citizen Science Platforms: Sourcing In-Situ Imagery

Citizen science platforms have revolutionized biodiversity monitoring by mobilizing millions of volunteers to collect georeferenced, photographic observations of nature. For an AI project focused on identifying living plants in the field, these platforms are an unparalleled source of training images.

**iNaturalist:** This platform is a global social network for sharing biodiversity information and is likely the largest single source of modern, in-situ photographs of Sarawak's flora.28 Its community-based identification system, where observations are vetted by other users, leads to a quality grade. Observations that receive a consensus identification from the community are promoted to "Research-Grade" status.28 For the SmartPlant Sarawak project, the acquisition strategy should focus exclusively on these research-grade observations, as they offer a high degree of taxonomic reliability. Data can be accessed by searching the platform's "Explore" page using the location filter for "Sarawak" and applying additional filters for plants, research-grade status, and a compatible Creative Commons license.31

**Pl@ntNet:** The project scope for SmartPlant Sarawak explicitly mentions being "inspired by platforms like Pl@ntNet".1 This platform is particularly relevant as it focuses exclusively on plants and uses its own AI model to suggest identifications, which are then refined by the community.29 Its dataset is a high-quality source of plant images and is also available through GBIF.

**Ethical Considerations and Data Security:** The use of public, georeferenced data carries significant ethical responsibilities, particularly in a biodiversity hotspot like Sarawak. There are documented cases where publicly available location data on platforms like iNaturalist has been allegedly used by poachers to find and illegally collect rare plants.33 This presents a direct and serious risk. The SmartPlant Sarawak project's own design specifications wisely include a requirement to "mask or hide exact GPS coordinates of rare/endangered plants".1 This is not just a feature to be implemented in the final app; it is a critical ethical safeguard that must be applied during the dataset curation phase. All records for species on IUCN Red Lists or local protected lists must have their precise coordinates either removed or generalized to a lower resolution (e.g., a 10x10 km grid) before being used for any purpose.

### 3.3. National and Regional Portals: The Malaysian Context

While global platforms provide volume, national data portals provide authoritative context and structure. The Malaysia Biodiversity Information System (MyBIS) is the country's official biodiversity repository and is essential for framing the data collection effort.

**Malaysia Biodiversity Information System (MyBIS):** MyBIS serves as Malaysia's national clearing-house mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity.34 It aggregates biodiversity information from various national agencies, including expert checklists and specimen databases.34 Its primary function for this project is not as a source of raw images, but as the most authoritative source for compiling a master species checklist for Sarawak. The MyBIS portal allows users to discover species and filter data by state, providing a baseline list of plant species officially recorded in Sarawak.37

**Application to the Project:** This master checklist is a prerequisite for a systematic data acquisition process. It transforms the goal from an amorphous "collect all plant images" to a structured "collect representative images for each of the X-thousand species on this list." This allows for a rigorous gap analysis, helping to identify which species are well-represented in the aggregated dataset and which require targeted data collection efforts in later phases.

| Data Source | Primary Type | Estimated Volume (Sarawak Plants) | Image Quality for AI | Georeferencing Precision | Data Licensing | Verification Status | Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GBIF** | Aggregated Occurrence Data | 100,000+ records | Variable; depends on original publisher. | Variable; requires filtering for geospatial issues.27 | Variable; must be checked per dataset. | Variable; depends on publisher's standards. | Massive scale; central access point for many sources.25 | Inconsistent data quality and metadata completeness.30 |
| **iNaturalist** | Citizen Science Observations | 50,000+ images | Generally high (in-situ photos); best when filtered for "Research-Grade." | High (GPS-based), but requires ethical masking for sensitive species.33 | Primarily Creative Commons (CC-BY, CC-BY-NC).28 | High for "Research-Grade" observations (community consensus).28 | Largest source of modern, in-situ images; strong community verification.38 | Potential for taxonomic bias toward common/showy species; poaching risk. |
| **Pl@ntNet** | Citizen Science Observations | 10,000+ images | High; focused on plant identification. | High (GPS-based). | Primarily Creative Commons.29 | High (community validated AI suggestions).29 | Plant-specific focus; dataset is directly relevant to the project's goals.1 | Smaller dataset compared to iNaturalist. |
| **MyBIS** | National Data Repository | 10,000+ species records | Limited image collection; primarily a metadata hub. | Variable; often at a regional or state level. | Government of Malaysia copyright. | High (derived from official sources and expert checklists).34 | Authoritative source for a national species checklist; includes conservation status.35 | Not a primary source of AI-training images; more of a reference tool. |

### 4. Part III: Uncovering Sarawak's Botanical Diaspora and Published Knowledge

To achieve true comprehensiveness, the data acquisition strategy must look beyond currently accessible digital records and delve into two critical supplementary sources: historical collections housed in international institutions and the foundational body of published scientific literature on the region's flora. These sources provide historical depth, taxonomic certainty, and the structural framework needed to build a complete dataset.

### 4.1. Global Herbaria and Historical Collections: The Botanical Diaspora

During the 19th and 20th centuries, extensive botanical exploration in Borneo resulted in vast collections of plant specimens being sent to institutions in Europe and North America. These collections, which include many of the original "type specimens" used to describe species for the first time, represent a "botanical diaspora" of Sarawak's natural heritage. Today, many of these institutions are undertaking large-scale digitization projects, making this invaluable historical data accessible online for the first time.

**Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBGK):** Kew Gardens in London houses one of the world's most important botanical collections, with over 8.5 million specimens.39 This includes extensive and historically significant collections from Borneo and Sarawak, gathered by explorers and botanists over the last two centuries.40 RBGK is in the process of digitizing its entire herbarium, making high-resolution images of specimen sheets and their label data available through its own online portal and data aggregators like GBIF.41 These digitized specimens provide definitive, verifiable data points for species occurrence and taxonomy. Kew also holds a collection of over 800 botanical paintings by the 19th-century artist Marianne North, including many detailed works of plants from her time in Sarawak, which could serve as valuable visual references.44

**Other Key Institutions:** Beyond Kew, other international institutions hold vital Sarawak collections. The Cambridge University Herbarium, for instance, holds the historic fern collection made by the famed naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace during his time in Sarawak in the 1850s; these specimens are also being digitized.46 Similarly, Harvard University Herbaria holds numerous specimens from Sarawak, collected by various expeditions, and provides online access to its specimen database.48 Systematically querying the online portals of these major international herbaria for specimens collected in "Sarawak" is a necessary step to capture the full taxonomic and historical breadth of the state's flora.

### 4.2. The "Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak" and Other Floristic Literature

The most authoritative knowledge of a region's flora is often consolidated in published scientific works known as "floras." These comprehensive treatments provide the taxonomic backbone for any serious biodiversity project.

**A Foundational Project:** The "Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak" is a landmark, multi-volume publication that represents the most systematic and modern attempt to document the tree species of Malaysian Borneo.52 It is a collaborative project between the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM), the Forest Department Sarawak (FDS), and the Sabah Forestry Department, involving dozens of local and international botanists.54 Since its inception in 1991, the project has published multiple volumes covering thousands of species, including the formal descriptions of nearly 200 species new to science.53

**Application to the Project:** Although these are physical books, their content is indispensable. The species lists, taxonomic keys, and detailed descriptions within these volumes must be considered the primary source of truth for the tree species of Sarawak. A key task in the initial phase of data acquisition will be to digitize the species checklists from these volumes. This digitized list will form the core of the project's master species checklist, which will be used to guide the search for images on digital platforms and to rigorously measure the completeness of the final aggregated dataset.

**Other Academic Resources:** Beyond the "Tree Flora," a wealth of other academic literature provides more focused botanical inventories. Scientific papers have been published detailing checklists of plants in specific habitats, such as peat swamp forests 57 and the Bau limestone area 58, or for particular plant groups, like medicinal plants used by the Melanau community 59 or the Zingiberaceae (ginger family) of Malesia.60 These publications are crucial for adding non-tree species to the master checklist and for understanding the fine-scale distribution of flora across Sarawak's diverse ecosystems.

### 4.3. Strategic Consideration: Brand Name and Trademark Risk

During the course of this strategic review, a significant non-technical risk has been identified that warrants immediate attention from the project leadership. The chosen project name, "SmartPlant Sarawak," while descriptive, presents a high risk of brand confusion and potential trademark infringement issues.

There are at least two major, established products with nearly identical names:

**SmartPlant:** A popular, global consumer mobile application for plant care, identification, and connecting with horticultural experts. It is available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and has a significant user base.61

**SmartPlant by Hexagon:** A comprehensive suite of industrial engineering and document management software used for designing and operating large-scale process and power plants.64

The existence of these well-established brands creates a direct collision in the digital marketplace. It will make it difficult for the "SmartPlant Sarawak" app to achieve visibility in app store searches, leading to user confusion and potentially hindering adoption. Furthermore, there is a legal risk associated with using a name that is so similar to a registered trademark (SmartPlant). It is strongly recommended that the project team conduct a formal brand review and consider adopting a more unique and distinctive name to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term success and identity of the application.

### 5. Part IV: A Phased Strategic Framework for Dataset Acquisition and Curation

Synthesizing the analysis of the institutional landscape, digital platforms, and supplementary resources, this section presents a concrete, four-phase action plan. This framework provides a logical and manageable progression from large-scale data aggregation to fine-grained curation, ensuring the development of a comprehensive, accurate, and ethically managed dataset ready for AI model training.

### 5.1. Phase 1: Aggregation and Scoping (Months 1-3)

The objective of this initial phase is to rapidly acquire all publicly available data and to establish the taxonomic framework that will guide the entire project.

**Action 1.1: Compile the Master Species Checklist.** This is the foundational task. It involves systematically extracting and digitizing the species lists from the most authoritative published sources. Priority sources include the published volumes of the "Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak" 52, the state-filtered species data from the Malaysia Biodiversity Information System (MyBIS) 37, and checklists from other key floristic papers on Sarawak's flora.57 The output will be a single, consolidated database of all known plant species in Sarawak.

**Action 1.2: Bulk Download from Digital Commons.** Concurrently, execute programmatic, scripted downloads of all relevant observation records for Sarawak from the primary global platforms. This includes:
Querying GBIF for all Plantae records within the administrative boundaries of Sarawak that have associated images and coordinates.25
Querying the iNaturalist API or export tool for all "Research-Grade" plant observations in Sarawak with a Creative Commons license.28

**Action 1.3: Initial Cleaning and Gap Analysis.** Once the bulk data is acquired, perform a preliminary automated cleaning process. This involves removing records that lack images, have obvious coordinate errors (e.g., (0,0)), or have incompatible licenses. The cleaned image dataset should then be cross-referenced against the Master Species Checklist. This will generate the project's first critical deliverable: a comprehensive gap analysis report that identifies which species are well-represented, which have poor-quality images, and which are missing entirely.

### 5.2. Phase 2: Formal Institutional Engagement (Months 2-6)

This phase runs in parallel with Phase 1 and focuses on the diplomatic and bureaucratic processes required to unlock the high-value, non-public data held by Sarawak's government agencies.

**Action 2.1: Formal Approach to Forest Department Sarawak (FDS).** Leveraging the official endorsement of the SFC, the project team, led by NeuonAI, should prepare and submit a formal proposal to the Director of the Forest Department Sarawak. The proposal must clearly articulate the project's conservation and public education goals, its alignment with state policy (e.g., PCDS 2030) 66, and the specific request: collaborative access to the metadata within the Sarawak Herbarium's BRAHMS database. The proposal should be framed as a partnership, offering to share the final application and its data insights with FDS to support their conservation work.

**Action 2.2: Formal Approach to Sarawak Biodiversity Centre (SBC).** A formal research application must be submitted through the SBC's online SORAS portal.13 This is a necessary and proactive step. Even if immediate fieldwork is not planned, having an approved research permit is essential for any future data collection activities (Phase 3). The application should also express interest in collaborating with SBC's researchers and exploring access to their internal botanical collections and data.

**Action 2.3: Establish Academic Collaboration with UNIMAS.** Initiate formal contact with the Dean of the Faculty of Resource Science and Technology at UNIMAS.21 The goal is to establish a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for research collaboration. This partnership can provide invaluable access to taxonomic experts for the data verification stage (Phase 4) and create opportunities for joint fieldwork and student involvement.

### 5.3. Phase 3: Targeted Data Generation and Gap-Filling (Months 7-12)

With the gap analysis from Phase 1 complete and the necessary permits from Phase 2 secured, this phase focuses on actively creating new data to fill the identified holes in the dataset.

**Action 3.1: Commission Targeted Field Photography.** Based on the detailed gap analysis report, create a priority list of under-represented and missing species. Commission local botanists, ecological consultants, or skilled photographers (potentially through the UNIMAS collaboration) to conduct targeted fieldwork to find and photograph these specific plants in their natural habitats. This ensures that the final dataset has coverage beyond the common, easily photographed species often found on citizen science platforms.

**Action 3.2: Propose a Pilot Herbarium Digitization Project.** If the engagement with FDS is successful and access to the physical herbarium is granted, propose a small-scale, well-defined pilot project. For example, offer to professionally digitize all specimens of a single, high-priority plant family at no cost to the FDS. This would demonstrate the project's value and technical capability, build trust, and potentially pave the way for a larger-scale digitization partnership that would benefit both the project and the long-term preservation of Sarawak's botanical heritage.

### 5.4. Phase 4: Curation, Verification, and Structuring for AI (Months 10-15)

This is the final and most technically intensive phase, where all collected data is unified, validated, and prepared for the AI development team.

**Action 4.1: Integrate All Data Sources.** Develop a unified database schema and ingest all data from the various sources: the bulk download from the Digital Commons, any metadata received from FDS/BRAHMS, data from SBC, and the newly generated images from targeted fieldwork.

**Action 4.2: Rigorous Taxonomic Verification.** This is a critical quality control step. Every species label in the dataset, especially those from citizen science sources, must be verified against the authoritative references (the Master Checklist derived from the "Tree Flora" and the BRAHMS metadata). This will be a combination of automated scripting (e.g., flagging names that are not on the master list) and manual expert review, which is where the collaboration with taxonomists from UNIMAS or FDS becomes invaluable.

**Action 4.3: Implement Ethical Safeguards for Sensitive Species.** A definitive script must be developed and applied to the entire georeferenced dataset. This script will cross-reference each record's species name against the IUCN Red List and any official protected species lists provided by SFC or FDS. For any match, the script must automatically obscure the precise GPS coordinates to a lower resolution (e.g., generalizing to a 0.1-degree grid cell), thereby mitigating the risk of facilitating poaching, as required by the project's own ethical standards.1

**Action 4.4: Structure for AI Model Training.** The final, cleaned, verified, and ethically scrubbed dataset must be organized into a format optimized for machine learning workflows. A common best practice is to structure the data into a directory of images organized into sub-folders, where each sub-folder is named after the scientific name of the species it contains. A master metadata file (e.g., in CSV or JSON format) should accompany this, linking each image file to its full metadata record (coordinates, date, source, conservation status, etc.). This final, structured dataset is the key deliverable to the AI development team.

### 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

The task of creating a comprehensive image dataset of all plants in Sarawak is a formidable but achievable goal that is fundamental to the success of the SmartPlant Sarawak project. This report has demonstrated that the path to acquiring this dataset is not through a single source but via a multi-pronged strategy that intelligently combines large-scale harvesting of public digital data with targeted, formal engagement of key local institutions.

The analysis leads to several core conclusions and actionable recommendations:

**A Hybrid Data Strategy is Essential:** Neither publicly available citizen science data nor restricted institutional data is sufficient on its own. The former provides the volume of in-situ images necessary for AI training but lacks taxonomic certainty and carries ethical risks. The latter provides the authoritative "ground truth" but is difficult to access and may not contain images suitable for the AI model's purpose. The optimal strategy, as outlined in the four-phase framework, is to use public data as the foundation and institutional data as the verification and enrichment layer.

**Institutional Engagement is a Diplomatic Process:** Access to the most valuable data, particularly the Sarawak Herbarium's BRAHMS database held by the Forest Department Sarawak, will not be granted through a simple technical request. It requires a formal, diplomatic approach that leverages the project's partnership with the Sarawak Forestry Corporation, respects the mandates of each government agency, and frames the project as a collaborative effort that offers tangible benefits for conservation and research in Sarawak.

**Proactive Planning is Crucial:** The processes for institutional engagement, particularly securing research permits from the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre via the SORAS system, require significant lead time. These processes must be initiated early in the project timeline, in parallel with the initial data aggregation phase, to avoid delays in later stages, such as targeted fieldwork.

**Ethical Responsibility Must Be Integrated from the Start:** The risk of misuse of location data for endangered species is real and severe. The requirement to protect this sensitive information cannot be an afterthought applied only to the final application. It must be a core principle of the data curation process itself, with robust procedures for identifying and obscuring sensitive locations in the training dataset.

**A Master Species Checklist is the Foundational Tool:** The project should not begin by simply collecting images. The first critical action is to compile an authoritative master species checklist from sources like the "Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak" and the Malaysia Biodiversity Information System. This checklist will provide the necessary structure to guide the entire data acquisition and curation process, enabling a systematic approach to identifying and filling data gaps.

By adopting the phased strategic framework detailed in this report, the SmartPlant Sarawak project can mitigate risks, manage complexity, and systematically build a dataset of the quality and comprehensiveness required to achieve its ambitious goals. The resulting dataset will be more than just fuel for an AI model; it will be a significant and lasting contribution to the documentation and conservation of Sarawak's globally important botanical heritage.
