### A Strategic Sourcing Plan for Botanical Image Data Acquisition

Date: 6th of October, 2025

---

### 1. Executive Summary

This report details the methodology and outcome of an iterative process to develop a comprehensive, "scorched earth" sourcing strategy for botanical images. The project's goal is to acquire a robust dataset of 33 categories of protected plants in Sarawak, Malaysia, for the purpose of training an offline mobile image classification model. The process began with a broad compilation of standard sources and, through a series of critical refinements driven by user feedback, evolved into a highly structured, multi-layered plan. A key turning point was the identification and correction of a significant omission—the Pl@ntNet platform—which led to a fundamental revision of the strategy. The final output is a definitive six-tier ranked list that functions as a strategic workflow, guiding the user from the most efficient online databases (Tier 1) to the ultimate step of proactive, in-person data generation (Tier 6). This structured approach ensures a thorough and efficient data collection process, fulfilling the project's mandate in its entirety.

### 2. Initial Strategy and Iterative Development

#### 2.1. The "Scorched Earth" Mandate and Initial Compilation

The project was initiated with the clear directive to compile an exhaustive list of image sources in a "scorched earth" manner. The initial phase focused on generating a broad-spectrum list of conventional and semi-specialized online resources. This foundational list was categorized by source type and included:
*   **Global Biodiversity Databases:** iNaturalist, GBIF.
*   **Institutional & Herbarium Collections:** Kew (POWO), Naturalis Biodiversity Center.
*   **Commercial Stock Photography:** Shutterstock, Alamy.
*   **Regional Malaysian Resources:** MyBIS, Sarawak Forestry Corporation.
*   **Specialized Sources:** Photographer portfolios, horticultural websites (e.g., Palmpedia).

#### 2.2. Deepening the Search into Unconventional Sources

In response to prompts to ensure absolute completeness, the strategy was expanded to include less obvious and more labor-intensive digital sources. This deepened the search by adding unconventional categories:
*   **Multimedia Platforms:** Extracting still frames from high-definition videos on YouTube and Vimeo.
*   **AI/ML Repositories:** Searching for pre-existing datasets on Kaggle and Hugging Face.
*   **Ecotourism & Commercial Galleries:** Sourcing images from tour operators and local lodges.
*   **Public Sector Documents:** Investigating government tenders and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for photographic appendices.

### 3. Critical Refinement and Strategic Revision

#### 3.1. Identification and Rectification of a Key Omission

A critical review by the user identified a significant oversight: the absence of the **Pl@ntNet** platform, a premier resource for plant identification and an ideal source of training data. Analysis concluded that this omission stemmed from a "conceptual overlap" flaw, where the inclusion of the similar platform iNaturalist had incorrectly satisfied the "citizen science database" category during the initial generation.

#### 3.2. Restructuring from a List to a Ranked Workflow

The identification of this flaw prompted a fundamental restructuring of the output. A simple, flat list was deemed insufficient for a practical workflow. To address this, all compiled sources were analyzed and organized into a **ranked, six-tier system**. This hierarchical structure transforms the list into a strategic guide, prioritizing sources based on their efficiency, accuracy, and image volume.

#### 3.3. Final Completeness Check

A final review was conducted to ensure no other major sources were overlooked. This resulted in two final additions to solidify the strategy:
*   **Encyclopedia of Life (EOL):** Re-introduced as a major scientific aggregator and placed in Tier 2.
*   **Google Images:** Explicitly defined not as a source itself, but as the essential master tool for searching across all other sources, emphasizing the use of scientific names and advanced search functions.

### 4. The Final Ranked Strategy: A Six-Tier Workflow

The final output of this process is a strategic plan organized into six tiers, designed to be executed in descending order of priority.

#### 4.1. Tier 1: The Gold Standard (Highest Priority)
This tier contains the most efficient, highest-yield sources. It includes the premier citizen science platforms **iNaturalist** and **Pl@ntNet**, the scientific data aggregator **GBIF**, and high-quality specialist photographer portfolios. These sources offer the best combination of volume, accuracy, and suitability for machine learning.

#### 4.2. Tiers 2 & 3: Scientific and High-Volume Sources
These tiers include core scientific resources like **Kew (POWO)** and other major herbaria, which provide a taxonomic baseline. They also cover high-volume generalist platforms like **Wikimedia Commons** and **Flickr**, which are excellent for gathering a large quantity of diverse images.

#### 4.3. Tiers 4 & 5: Deep Dives and Labor-Intensive Searches
These tiers represent a shift towards more effort-intensive methods for finding images of rarer species. They include searching through specialized commercial nursery websites, social media forums, digitized historical literature (**Biodiversity Heritage Library**), and unconventional sources like video platforms and EIA reports.

#### 4.4. Tier 6: Proactive Data Generation (The Last Resort)
This final tier is executed when online sources are exhausted. It moves beyond searching for existing data to creating new data. This involves:
*   **Directly contacting** researchers and curators.
*   **Commissioning** local photographers in Sarawak.
*   **Conducting an in-person field expedition.**

### 5. Conclusion

The development of this image sourcing plan demonstrates the value of an iterative and critical review process. The initial broad compilation was systematically deepened and refined, with a key correction fundamentally improving the strategy's quality. The resulting six-tier ranked list provides a clear, comprehensive, and actionable workflow that perfectly aligns with the project's "scorched earth" mandate. By following this prioritized guide, the user can conduct their data acquisition efforts in the most efficient manner possible, ensuring the creation of a high-quality dataset suitable for their machine learning objectives.
